# Ideas

The goal for this project is to create a framework to help interface between Godot and AI APIs to help game developers create more personalized experiences in an easy way.

## Rough Ideas
- Ideally make this a Godot plugin
- Use OpenAI for personalized story interactions?
- Use Co:here for semantic analyze of answers for more appropriate character reactions?
- Use Uberduck to allow characters to speak written or generated dialog?
- Use Assembly AI for easy subtitle creation?
- Use Stability AI for generating dynamic backdrops or other personalized content?
